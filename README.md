# Titanic_Survival_Predictor

### This project is portraying a use case , which is technically solved using the core concepts of binary classification and logistic regression in Machine Learning .

#### The use case that has been show-cased here is : 
#### We all know about the gigantic and the luxury ship called *TITANIC* . The history associated with it , is how it got submerged by the hit of an iceberg . There were many who lost their lives and also who survived this disaster . 
#### So in future , let's talk about the 21st Century , if such a ship similar to *TITANIC* sets sail , and this incident or disaster again occures (which is very rare to occur , because now we have advanced technologies already dominating the world) ..... Then , the people onboard the ship , who already are aware of thr historical event in the past , can leverage this application or website , to get a prediction of their survival 

---

### Technologies and Concepts used:

#### The website is built using *HTML5* and *CSS* . For the clients or passengers to use this website or web app , it has been hosted on a webserver in a Virtual Machine (*REDHAT*) . The webserver that hase been used is *APACHE WEBSERVER*

#### By default , the webserver is running on port number *80*
#### Make sure to write the firewall rule in the virtual machine , to allow traffic on port number 80 , i.e., for our web server 

#### The *change* that you have to make , if you downoad or copy the *FRONT END CODE* into your local system , is that *update the ip address* for the url in the *form* tag of HTML . It should be the ip address of your own Virtual Machine . 

#### In the *BACKEND* , the Python CGI and API programming script has been written , along with the *MACHINE LEARNING* code , that does the prediction .
