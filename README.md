# Titanic_Survival_Predictor

### This project is portraying a use case , which is technically solved using the core concepts of binary classification and logistic regression in Machine Learning .

#### The use case that has been show-cased here is : 
#### We all know about the gigantic and the luxury ship called *TITANIC* . The history associated with it , is how it got submerged by the hit of an iceberg . There were many who lost their lives and also who survived this disaster . 
#### So in future , let's talk about the 21st Century , if such a ship similar to *TITANIC* sets sail , and this incident or disaster again occures (which is very rare to occur , because now we have advanced technologies already dominating the world) ..... Then , the people onboard the ship , who already are aware of thr historical event in the past , can leverage this application or website , to get a prediction of their survival .
